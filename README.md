## What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned:

- How to build a full-stack web application using React.js and Node.js
- How to integrate a MongoDB database with a Node.js backend
- How to implement pagination for efficiently managing large datasets
- How to handle user authentication and authorization for secure access to protected routes
- Best practices for designing responsive web interfaces using Bootstrap

## Challenges Faced

Some of the challenges I encountered during the development process included:
